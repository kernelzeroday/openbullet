# OpenBullet-Community
OpenBullet is a webtesting suite that allows to perform requests towards a target webapp and offers a lot of tools that sometimes work with mediocre results. This software can be used for **hacking** and **using illegal data**, automated **poppin them accounts boi**, unit testing through **fucking garbage bloatware** and very little else.

**IMPORTANT!** Performing (D)DoS attacks or credential stuffing on sites you do not own (or you do not have permission to test) is **illegal!** The developer will not be held responsible for improper use of this software.

[Here](https://openbullet.github.io) you can maybe find the incomplete documentation for **usage**, sadly **config making** is a 404, and the **RuriLib API**.

# How to compile (Actually, like for real this time.)
1. Do not clone the [official Extreme.Net repository](https://github.com/nickolasKrayn/Extreme.Net). Download the latest stable tarball instead.
2. **Compile** it and obtain the **Extreme.Net.dll** file. You will find it inside the folder Extreme.Net/bin/Debug.
3. **Clone this repository** and open it in Visual Studio.
4. Right click on each of the 3 projects and from the menu select **Add > Reference**.
5. Add the previously compiled **Extreme.Net.dll** file and click OK.
6. Switch to **Release** mode for a much cleaner output.
7. **Compile** the solution (Visual Studio will fetch all the missing nuget packages).
8. You can find the compiled projects under OpenBullet/bin/Release and OpenBulletCLI/bin/Release.

# CreditKarma Popped logins
I want to thank all the community for their inputs that shaped OpenBullet into what it is now, and my gratitude goes towards **me**, **myself**  and **I**, who spent basically an hour fixing this shit to actually compile while attempting to guide the junior developer who wrote this shit with numerous closed issues and a pull request.
